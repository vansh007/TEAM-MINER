Steps to run K means:

Step 1:
Copy the project into local disk

Step 2: 
Open the project location in Jupyter Notebook

Step 3: 
Naviagte to folder K Means and run the 'preprocessing.ipynb' (shortcut to run "Shift+Enter") file

Step 4:
Now there should be a csv file named preprocessed_data in the folder named data.

Step 5:
As per your required input change the values in Input.txt.

Step 6:
In OuputGeneration.ipynb, Number of clusters can be changed as per requirement for the variable ks

Step 7:
Execute 'OutputGeneration.ipynb' (shortcut to run Shift+Enter)

Step 8:
The accuracy.csv file will be generated in the output folder. This will give accuracy and time taken to run for each of the input specified.
